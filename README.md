==============

This app is a Fieldable Panel Pane with responsive imaging.  This FPP will go 1/3 of the container.

Things you will need to do:

<li>After enabling this app is go to Appearance and scan your default theme for breakpoints.</li>
<li>You can also check to make sure your breakpoints worked here: admin/config/media/breakpoints</li>
<li>Go to admin/structure/fieldable-panels-panes/manage/hot-primary-tout-third/display</li>
<li>Make sure the Format for the 1/3 Picture = Picture</li>
